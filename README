Example code to accompany my Scala Days 2011 presentation on exploring
lightweight event sourcing. For the slides, see
http://www.slideshare.net/dlrozendaal/exloring-lightweight-event-sourcing.

To start the application, run "sbt jetty" and point your browser to
http://localhost:8080/

Functionality is extremely limited, but give you some idea on how 
event sourcing can be implemented.
